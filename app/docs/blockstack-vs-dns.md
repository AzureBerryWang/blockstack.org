As with the traditional domain name system, the Blockstack domain name system allows users to lookup, register, renew, and transfer names, as well as manage name resolution information.

But, Blockstack DNS differs in a few fundamental ways from traditional DNS.

First, while the traditional domain name system is run by an international organization called ICANN, the Blockstack name registry is maintained in a completely decentralized way. It is run by everyone and it is controlled by no one, giving Blockstack DNS incredible and unprecedented technical and sociopolitical resilience.

Second, while traditional DNS relies on a fragile system of disseminating name resolution information, making it vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning, Blockstack DNS has a powerful mechanism for securely transmitting name resolution information that is 100% accurate.

And last, Blockstack DNS and traditional DNS differ in how they associate names with certificates. Traditional DNS has no built-in system for securely associating names with cryptographic keypairs, so instead it relies on a hierarchy of anointed organizations to attest to the ownership of domains. Here, each organization represents a systemic threat to name resolution security. By comparison, in Blockstack DNS every name is automatically associated with a cryptographic keypair, allowing end-users to have trust in the authenticity of information sent by servers associated with the name.
