Blockstack's DNS system allows anyone to create namespaces or directories for their decentralized applications.

The first namespace is for referring to user identities (TLD: .id). These identities are called "blockchain IDs" because they are identities registered on the blockchain. The blockchain ID namespace is being utilized by services like [Onename](https://onename.com), [Nametiles](http://nametiles.co), [OB1](http://ob1.io), [Bitseed](http://bitseed.org) and more.
