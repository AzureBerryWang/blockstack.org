Blockstack is the application stack for building decentralized, blockchain-based applications that don't need any servers to operate. Blockstack applications can be built quickly by plugging into Blockstack's services for identity, naming, storage and authentication.

With the Blockstack software, a network of computers collectively maintain a global registry of identities, public keys and names. When you run a Blockstack node, you join this network, which is more secure by design than traditional identity, naming, and digital registry systems. This is because the system's registry and its records are secured by an underlying blockchain, which is extremely resilient against tampering and control.

In the registry that makes up Blockstack, each of the identities/names has an owner, represented by a cryptographic keypair, and is associated with instructions for how DNS resolvers and other software should resolve the name.

Blockstack Naming provides:

- name lookups on a decentralized naming system
- name registrations and transfers without centralized registrars
- automatic binding of names to owning cryptographic keypairs
- automatic cache invalidation
- immunity to cache poisoning
- robust certificate pinning capabilities
- resistance to censorship of name registration and resolution

Blockstack Identity provides:

- self-sovereign, user-controlled identities
- selective disclosure of identity information
- secure, user-administered authentication
- app-specific data storage
- user-controlled data authorization
