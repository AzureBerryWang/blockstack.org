Blockstack is decentralized DNS.

With the Blockstack software, a network of computers collectively maintain a global registry of domain names.

When you run a Blockstack node, you join this network, which is more secure by design than traditional DNS and much more resilient to outside tampering and control.

In the registry that makes up Blockstack DNS, each of the names has an owner, represented by a cryptographic keypair, and is associated with instructions for how browsers and other software should resolve the name.

Blockstack provides:

- name lookups on a decentralized naming system
- name registrations and transfers without centralized registrars
- automatic binding of names to owning cryptographic keypairs
- automatic cache invalidation
- immunity to DNS cache poisoning
- robust certificate pinning capabilities
- resistance to censorship of name registration and resolution
