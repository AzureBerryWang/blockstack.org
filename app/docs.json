Developers will be able to use this stack to create decentralized versions of\npopular online services like [Amazon](http://openbazaar.org), [YouTube](http://blocktech.com), [Twitter](http://twister.net.co), [Reddit](http://datt.co), or even a whole new way of [publishing data](http://ipfs.io), and [browsing websites](http://zeronet.io). Many applications are using the same or similar components to achieve decentralization, and Blockstack is working to combine these tools into a simple yet powerful software stack for developers of decentralized applications to build with.\n\nSince launching the Blockstack website a little over two months ago, an incredible amount of attention and support has poured into this community from talented and passionate developers and enthusiasts from all over the world. Developers from companies and projects such as [2WAY.io](http://2way.io), [Bitmarkets](http://bitmarkets.org), [Bitseed](http://bitseed.org), [Chord](http://trychord.com), [creativework.info](http://creativework.info), [DATT](http://datt.co), [Fabric](http://fabric.fm), [Mine](http://mine.nyc), [Nametiles](http://nametiles.co), [OB1](http://ob1.io), [the okTurtles Foundation](http://okturtles.org), [Stampery](http://stampery.co), [Tierion](http://tierion.com), and [ZeroNet](http://zeronet.io) have joined the Blockstack community and are already contributing code and ideas. We have started and continued important discussions both in the [forum](http://forum.blockstack.org) and [slack](http://chat.blockstack.org) about the future of decentralized application development and the role Blockstack will play in this space going forward. Progress is being made and issues are being resolved.

Run the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ blockstack register <YOUR FULL NAME>.id\n```\n\nIf the name hasn’t been registered yet, you’ll get a confirmation that your registration is pending:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"Name queued up for registration. Please expect a few hours for this process to be completed.\",\n  \"error\": false\n}\n```\n\nAfter a few hours, your registration should go through and you’ll be able to update your DNS records for the name.\n\n### Updates\n\nTo update the data record associated with a name you own, run the `blockstack update` command:\n\n```bash\n$ blockstack update '{ \"cname\": [{\"name\": \"@\", \"alias\": \"https://zk9.s3.amazonaws.com/yeezy.id\"}] }'\n```\n\nExpected response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"Data record updated.\",\n  \"error\": false\n}\n```","title":"Basic Usage","description":"Explore Blockstack usage, including looking up & registering names.","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165205744-3b78555e5572","next":"extended-usage"},"blockstack-vs-dns":{"markdown":"\n\nAs with the traditional domain name system, the Blockstack domain name system allows users to lookup, register, renew, and transfer names, as well as manage name resolution information.\n\nBut, Blockstack DNS differs in a few fundamental ways from traditional DNS.\n\nFirst, while the traditional domain name system is run by an international organization called ICANN, the Blockstack name registry is maintained in a completely decentralized way. It is run by everyone and it is controlled by no one, giving Blockstack DNS incredible and unprecedented technical and sociopolitical resilience.\n\nSecond, while traditional DNS relies on a fragile system of disseminating name resolution information, making it vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning, Blockstack DNS has a powerful mechanism for securely transmitting name resolution information that is 100% accurate.\n\nAnd last, Blockstack DNS and traditional DNS differ in how they associate names with certificates. Traditional DNS has no built-in system for securely associating names with cryptographic keypairs, so instead it relies on a hierarchy of anointed organizations to attest to the ownership of domains. Here, each organization represents a systemic threat to name resolution security. By comparison, in Blockstack DNS every name is automatically associated with a cryptographic keypair, allowing end-users to have trust in the authenticity of information sent by servers associated with the name.\n","title":"Blockstack vs. Traditional DNS","description":"Learn about how Blockstack DNS differs from traditional ICANN DNS.","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165205744-3b78555e5572","next":"blockstack-vs-namecoin"},"blockstack-vs-namecoin":{"markdown":"\n\nBlockstack DNS differs from Namecoin DNS in a few fundamental ways.\n\nFirst, they differ in how the domain name system is operated. Namecoin DNS is operated by nodes of a cryptocurrency called Namecoin, which is a fork of Bitcoin that has it's own separate blockchain. Blockstack DNS, meanwhile, is operated by nodes that read data from and write data to an underlying blockchain, which can be any blockchain that they are configured to operate on top of. The logic for operating the domain name system is decoupled from the logic of the underlying blockchain. This allows a Blockstack network to be configured to operate on any Blockchain in particular, and the main Blockstack network is currently operating on the most secure blockchain - the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSecond, with Namecoin DNS, routing information is stored directly in the blockchain, which can lead to quite a bit of blockchain bloat. Blockstack DNS, meanwhile, stores only hashes of routing information records in the blockchain, deciding to store the rest in decentralized content-addressable storage units (by default, Blockstack is configured to store data in a DHT). These routing records then can link to other data stored elsewhere, whether that be in a DHT or on a hosted data storage provider like S3. This makes for a much more scalable and cost-efficient design.\n\nThird, with Namecoin DNS, all names are set at the same low price and there are no options for users to create new namespaces and set their own name pricing schemes. This results in rampant squatting and significantly degrades the user experience for anyone trying to register names. Blockstack DNS, meanwhile, has a wide range of options for users to create their own namespaces and set their own name pricing schemes. Namespaces can be created with really cheap names (great for a username namespace) or they can be created with really expensive names (great for a domain namespace resilient to squatting). Name prices can be set to go down with an increase in the number of characters or with the presence of numbers and special characters. And names can be set to expire in a year or they can be set to never expire at all. All these options allow users to design namespaces that encourage registration of names that users want and are willing to pay for, while dis-incentivizing the mass registration of names by squatters. All this leads to a superior user experience for everyone involved.\n\nLast, Blockstack DNS has support for a bunch of really powerful features that Namecoin DNS simply does not. This includes support for multi-party ownership of names, support for light nodes (enabling secure lookups by mobile devices and desktop users with limited ability to run their own nodes), and support for creating namespaces with a pre-instantiated list of names (to facilitate migration of a namespace from another DNS system, like ICANN DNS).","title":"Blockstack vs. Namecoin","description":"Learn about how Blockstack DNS differs from Namecoin.","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165205744-3b78555e5572","next":"faq"},"extended-usage":{"markdown":"\n\n### Transfers\n\nTo transfer a name that you own to another address, run the `blockstack transfer` command:\n\n```bash\n$ blockstack transfer <name> <recipient>\n```\n\nExpected response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"Name queued up for transfer.\",\n  \"error\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Renewals\n\nTo renew a name that you own, run the `blockstack renew` command:\n\n```bash\n$ blockstack renew <name>\n```\n\nExpected response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"Name queued up for renewal.\",\n  \"error\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Your Names\n\nTo get a list of the names you own, run the `blockstack names` command:\n\n```bash\n$ blockstack names\n```\n\nExpected response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"names_owned\": [],\n  \"addresses\": [\n    { \"address\": \"1Jbcrh9Lkwm73jXyxramFukViEtktwq8gt\", \"names\": [] }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Your Balance\n\nTo get your Bitcoin balance that can be used for name registrations, run the `blockstack balance` command:\n\n\n```bash\n$ blockstack balance\n```\n\nExpected response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"balance\": 0.05,\n  \"addresses\": [\n    { \"address\": \"1EHgqHVpA1tjn6RhaVj8bx6y5NGvBwoMNS\", \"balance\": 0.05 }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Importing\n\nTo import a name into your local name wallet or receive it from another sender, get your address with the `blockstack import` command:\n\n```bash\n$ blockstack import\n```\n\nExpected response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"address\": \"1Jbcrh9Lkwm73jXyxramFukViEtktwq8gt\"\n}\n```\n\n### Whois Information\n\nTo get various information on a given name, including when it was registered and the address it is owned by, run the `blockstack whois` command:\n\n```bash\n$ blockstack whois fredwilson.id\n```\n\nExample response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"block_preordered_at\": 374084,\n  \"block_renewed_at\": 374084,\n  \"owner_address\": \"1F2nHEDLRJ39XxAvSxwQhJsaVzvS5RHDRM\",\n  \"owner_public_keys\": [\"0411d88aa37a0eea476a5b63ca4b1cd392ded830865824c27dacef6bde9f9bc53fa13a0926533ef4d20397207e212c2086cbe13db5470fd29616abd35326d33090\"],\n  \"owner_script\": \"76a91499e7f97f5d2c77b4f32b4ed9ae0f0385c45aa5c788ac\",\n  \"preorder_transaction_id\": \"2986ec31ec957692d7f5bc58a3b02d2ac2d1a60039e9163365fc954ff51aeb5a\",\n  \"registered\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Blockstack Server Updates\n\nTo update the blockstack server that your command line is connecting to, use the `blockstack config` command:\n\n```bash\n$ blockstack config --server=server.blockstack.org --port=6264\n```\n\nExpected response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"Configuration settings updated.\",\n  \"error\": false\n}\n```","title":"Extended Usage","description":"Dig deeper with Blockstack usage, including name transfers and more.","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165205744-3b78555e5572","next":"what-is-blockstack"},"faq":{"markdown":"\n\n### How is Blockstack DNS different from ICANN DNS?\n\nSee this article for a full explanation:\n\n[Blockstack DNS vs ICANN DNS](/docs/blockstack-vs-dns)\n\n### How is Blockstack DNS different from Namecoin DNS?\n\nSee this article for a full explanation:\n\n[Blockstack DNS vs Namecoin DNS](/docs/blockstack-vs-namecoin)\n\n### What blockchain is Blockstack DNS built on?\n\nBlockstack DNS, meanwhile, is operated by nodes that read data from and write data to an underlying blockchain, which can be any blockchain that they are configured to operate on top of. The logic for operating the domain name system is decoupled from the logic of the underlying blockchain. This allows a Blockstack network to be configured to operate on any Blockchain in particular, and the main Blockstack network is currently operating on the most secure blockchain - the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n### Why isn't there a Blockstack network on a blockchain other than the Bitcoin blockchain?\n\nIt makes sense to focus on building one network out and putting energy into helping that network grow and succeed.\n\nOf course, anyone could create a parallel Blockstack network on another blockchain, but the Blockstack development community has made the decision to operate the first network on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n### Are DNS records stored in the blockchain?\n\nNo, only hashes of these records are stored in the blockchain. The records themselves are stored elsewhere and the Blockstack resolvers look up the full records by their hash. By default, records are stored in the Blockstack DHT (based on Kademlia).\n\n### Can I run my own Blockstack node?\n\nYes, it's simple to get up and running. See this article for full instructions:\n\n[Blockstack installation](/docs/installation)\n\n### Why does a name have to be preordered before it is registered?\n\nWhen a name is registered, that name registration is broadcast to the world. Anyone who sees a broadcasted transaction can replay the transaction, so if there was just a single registration step, then names would get stolen all the time. A two-stage commit process is employed to fix this, where one first says \"I'm registering an undisclosed name\" and then later says \"I'm registering this name and here's proof that I meant to register this particular name earlier on\" (referencing a hash in the first transaction).\n\n### Is there support for names that don't ever expire?\n\nYes. Each namespace has it's own settings, so if you'd like to register names that don't expire, simply use a namespace that has a flag set for non-expiration.\n\n### Does name ownership have multi-party support?\n\nAbsolutely. Blockstack supports multi-party ownership and more (in bitcoin, this is accomplished using multi-signature addresses). Any valid Bitcoin script (also known as a \"scriptPubKey\") may be set as the owner of a name.\n","title":"FAQ","description":"A list of questions frequently asked about Blockstack.","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165205744-3b78555e5572"},"installation":{"markdown":"\n\nThe quickest way to get started with Blockstack and get a glimpse of what it can do is to download the command line interface and perform a name lookup.\n\nInstalling the Blockstack command line interface is simple if you have pip.
