### Mission

Blockstack’s mission is to enable an open, decentralized internet which will benefit all internet users by giving them more control over information and computation. We’re committed to always support the decentralization of the Blockstack network and ensure that we build the network in a way that no single entity, including Blockstack PBC, has control over it.
