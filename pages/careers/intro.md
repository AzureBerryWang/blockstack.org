## Blockstack enables a new generation of apps that empower users by putting them in control.

Weâ€™re headquartered in New York City, with a globally distributed team that includes computer scientists from Princeton, Stanford, MIT and other top universities. We are continually recognized as one of the most well respected decentralized computing projects for engineering excellence, application quality, and regulatory compliance. Blockstack is, quite simply, the best learning-lab on earth for those who want to level-up their experience and impact in blockchain and decentralized tech.

The open-source community we have is at the heart of everything we do, and our team constantly engages with external experts, users, and builders via [Slack](https://docs.google.com/a/blockstack.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSed5Mnu0G5ZMJdWs6cTO_8sTJfUVfe1sYL6WFDcD51_XuQkZw/viewform), [GitHub](https://github.com/blockstack), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blockstack), and the Blockstack [Forum](https://forum.blockstack.org/).

Blockstack PBC has raised $55M+ in capital to develop core protocols and developer tools for the ecosystem. Being a Public Benefit Corp also means we have goals beyond profit, and that allows us to focus on universal human rights and sharing the value created in our ecosystem. We also care deeply about building a diverse team.
