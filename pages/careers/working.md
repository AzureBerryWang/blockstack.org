### Working at Blockstack

- **Collaborate with the brightest minds:** Blockstack was started at Princeton by a small team of computer scientists. First principles thinking and critical inquiry are in our team DNA. Brainstorming, debate, and collaboration are encouraged for all roles and at all job levels.
- **Remote first:** Our team is mostly remote and our daily rituals and meetings are planned around to be remote friendly. We offer flexible work hours and try to keep Tuesdays and Thursdays meeting free.
- **Community and ecosystem:** The Blockstack team is small, but our open-source community is massive. We have a shared slack with over 7000 blockchain engineers, decentralized app developers, and crypto investors. We also hold over 100 global events, meetups, hackathons, and developer summits each year. Our community is a great resource for learning and growth beyond our core team.
- **Growth potential:** These are early days in for the Blockstack ecosystem and for decentralized computing and we are rapidly growing. If you join now, you’ll get to work on the bleeding edge of technology, policy, and innovation. We offer an environment that encourages you to work on [side projects](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/introducing-radiks-a-framework-for-building-blockstack-apps/7414), spearhead that [new campaign](https://app.co/mining), take responsibility of [cutting-edge](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/blockstack-annual-hard-fork-2018/6518) tech roll-out, and in some cases, [join new teams](https://github.com/blockstack/app-mining/graphs/contributors).
- **Running a marathon, not a sprint:** The world is not going to move away from centralized services to more secure, decentralized alternatives in a few years. Given the scale of long-term work we’re taking on, it’s extremely important to us that team members don’t burn themselves out or miss out on life. We don’t just pay lip service to work/life balance, it’s a core strategy for success in the long-term.
