We get a lot of applicants, and have historically hired people who are proactively involved in our work and mission of decentralizing the internet. Even a simple pull request goes a long way in signaling interest in the project. We hope you explore our Github, Whitepaper, Browser, and Slack prior to submitting your resume.
