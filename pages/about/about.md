#### Blockstack is a full-stack decentralized computing protocol that enables a new generation of applications where developers and users can interact fairly and securely

### Mission

Blockstack’s mission is to foster an open and decentralized Internet that establishes and protects privacy, security and freedom for all users.

### What is Blockstack

Blockstack is a full-stack decentralized computing protocol that enables a new generation of applications where developers and users can interact fairly and securely. Through blockchain technology, Blockstack builds protocols and developer tools designed to enable a fair and open Internet that returns digital rights to developers and consumers. Led by some of the world’s foremost experts on distributed systems, Blockstack allows users to own their own data that they can take with them from app to app in the ecosystem, along with their Blockstack ID that eliminates the need for password-based logins. The end result is privacy, security, and freedom.

### How Blockstack Works

The Blockstack team rethought internet applications from first principles: You should own and control your online identity, your identity should work with all apps, all your application data should be encrypted, and only you have the decryption-key to share that data.

Years have been spent building an architecture that would support these principles. We use a dedicated Blockchain to provision Blockstack IDs and execute smart-contracts. We use a purpose built distributed storage network to hold encrypted data. And we wrap all that infrastructure in simple javascript API that any developer can use.

From there, developers are free to build high-quality apps with no middlemen, no passwords, and no massive data silos to breach. There are many [Blockstack apps already in production](https://app.co/blockstack) and more being built every day with the participation of the online open source community in [App Mining](https://app.co/mining) and in partnership with VC Bounties Programs.

### The Blockstack Manifesto

Blockstack believes that every individual is empowered with the following rights:

1. The right to own digital property, including data created by a user in-app
2. The right to choose how you interact with your digital property
3. Freedom of speech, which include words, code & money, and no 3rd party should have veto power over the words a user wants to say, the code a user wants to run or a transfer of value the user wants to make
4. The right to Privacy: Users’ private information should remain private unless they choose otherwise
5. Freedom of assembly: Users should be able to interact with whomever they desire without a middleman who can track, prevent, or influence the interaction
6. Freedom of choice: Users should have the right to switch or exit services and applications without loss of their personal data
7. The right not to be a ‘hostage’ to powers in a given network
8. The right to be forgotten
9. The right to access your information
10. The right to “win” when a user instruction on a device and a remote instruction are in conflict.
