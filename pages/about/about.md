#### Blockstack is a full-stack decentralized computing network that enables a new generation of applications where developers and users can interact fairly and securely.

### Mission

Blockstack’s mission is to foster an open and decentralized Internet that establishes and protects privacy, security and freedom for all internet users.

### What is Blockstack

Blockstack is a full-stack decentralized computing network that enables a new generation of applications where developers and users can interact fairly and securely. Blockstack’s core protocols and developer tools enable a fair and open Internet that returns digital rights to developers and consumers. Led by some of the world’s foremost experts on distributed systems, Blockstack allows users to own their own data that they can take with them from app to app in the ecosystem, along with their Blockstack ID that eliminates the need for password-based logins. The end result is privacy, security, and freedom.

### Stats

- 4+ years of R&D with publications in peer-reviewed conferences
- More than 80 independent apps currently built on the network
- Over 7,000 members in the community of enthusiasts and developer
- 6,000+ Meetup Members in more than 40 groups on 6 continents

### How Blockstack Works

The Blockstack team rethought internet applications from first principles: You should own and control your online identity, your identity should work with all apps, all your application data should be encrypted, and only you have the decryption-key to share that data.

Years have been spent building an architecture that would support these principles and provide a solid, scalable foundation. We use a dedicated Blockchain, designed for decentralized apps, to provision Blockstack IDs and execute smart-contracts. We use a purpose built decentralized storage network to hold encrypted data with performance comparable to the cloud. And we wrap all that infrastructure in simple javascript API that any developer can use.

From there, developers are free to build high-quality apps with no middlemen, no passwords, and no massive data silos to breach. There are many [Blockstack apps already in production](https://app.co/mining) and more being built every day with the participation of the online open source community in [App Mining](https://app.co/mining) and in partnership with VC Bounties Programs.
