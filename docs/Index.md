# Intro to Blockstack

Blockstack is decentralized DNS.

When you run a Blockstack node, you join a network of computers in maintaining a global registry of domain names that is more secure by design than traditional DNS and much more resilient to outside tampering and control.

Blockstack gives you:

- name lookups on a decentralized naming system
- name registrations and transfers without centralized registrars
- automatic binding of names to owning cryptographic keypairs
- automatic cache invalidation
- immunity to DNS cache poisoning
- robust certificate pinning capabilities
- resistence to censorship of name registration and resolution
